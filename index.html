      <h1>Identity</h1>
      <p>I can't change who I was in the past, but I can change who I am now and who I am going to be forward. "You're not what you think you are; you're not what others think you are; you're what you think others think you are."&ndash;and therefore I have to change my behavoiur now to affect my identity tomorrow.</p>
